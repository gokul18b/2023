In India we don’t have any direct communication between the government and public in an efficient way for solving the problems. I.e., for getting a problem solved in our place we have to bribe the officials and get them solved in 2 months which can be solved actually in 1 month of time. In order to make the goal of NIC come true we are going to develop a system which will be able to provide the complete information to the public at any point of time regarding the problems. They are facing currently and what is the impact of it and then how effectively the funds are utilized for the development purpose can be known by public which also includes the online discussion forums and feedback forms which will help them to communicate well with the government.
